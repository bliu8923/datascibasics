    "# Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "Is it possible to predict the current rank of the officer in the complaint based on other information about the allegation? This would be a classification problem, so we ended up using the .score() method of the DecisionTreeClassifier as our evaluation metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Model\n",
    "For the baseline model, we decided to do basic one-hot encoding for the categorical features, and just allowed quantitative columns to remain the same (scaling them seemed to diminish our accuracy by a small margin).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nominal Features\n",
    "Nominal features were the unique_mos_id(unique IDs for each officer), command_now, command_at_incident, mos_gender, mos_ethnicity, complainant_gender, complainant_ethnicity, board_disposition, allegation, and fado_type. We also wanted to clarify that for the baseline model, we included rank_at_incident as a nominal feature since we first believed that rank was another name for a job classification (i.e. a detective and an officer were just different jobs with different needs, not one above the other). We also cannot consider it as an ordinal feature since our prediction is being made on rank_now, which is supposedly ordinal but as a classification problem we cannot predict ordinal and must stick with these features being nominal. It would be counter intuitive to manipulate the y values of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quantitative Features\n",
    "Quantitative features were the rest of the features, mainly ages of both the officer and complainant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In total, we used 10 nominal features and 3 quantitative features for a grand total of 13 features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Performance\n",
    "After training a model multiple times, we noticed that scores of our training data would average around 0.72-0.73 with a tree depth of 10, while scores with our test data would average 0.70-0.72, meaning that overall this was a pretty good model to begin with. There were a lot of features that we were excited to add on, however, given that there is still a pretty good room for improvement from this model. If these 13 features can allow for 70% of our predictions to be correct (considering that there is a pretty good spread of the types of ranks possible in the dataset), I would say that this model is pretty good given it's a baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Model\n",
    "For the final model, we added a couple features that we thought would improve our chances of classifying the current rank of officers:\n",
    "#### Previous Number of Allegations\n",
    "An officer that gets a lot of allegations against them might be less likely to get a promotion since they are constantly caught up in other issues instead of performing well to get promoted. Additionally, an officer who is constantly being reported is likely doing something wrong. By using the unique_mos_id of each officer, we were able to replace that value with the number of allegations the officer had in the entire dataset.\n",
    "#### Change in Command\n",
    "An officer that changes precincts might also be more likely to get such a promotion, since changing precincts indicates instability in their previous environment that makes it difficult for promotion. Alternatively, an officer may be transferred to a precinct because there are disturbances taking place. This may present the officer with more opportunities for promotion in the new location. Of course, either of these could work against the officer and lead them to getting fewer promotions. There may also be an interpersonal element. Officers may work better around different people. It might also work the other way, in the case that an officer who does not work well with anyone would be transferred to a large number of precincts without a promotion at all. In any case, we believe this parameter to be relevant to the promotions an officer receives.\n",
    "#### Race Binarizer\n",
    "In society today and in the past, white people have had the structural and infrastructural advantage. By binarizing the officers into white and non-white people, we aimed to further accentuate the difference in treatment that they received. For example, we expect white officers to receive more promotions than non-white officers. We aimed to make it easier for the model to recognize this difference to give better accuracy to both populations.\n",
    "#### Age Bins\n",
    "We added this because we expect for age to correlate with promotion. The binning was done because we do not expect officers of minute age differences to receive vastly different treatments regarding promotions for good reason. By this, we mean that if 25 year olds receive a disproportionately high number of promotions compared to  24 or 26 year olds, we believe this to be the result of an outlier or a unique and rare case that happened to take place for those officers. We can limit the impact of such occurrences by binning the data, so that the burst of promotions is spread out among more officers. In the case that no such cases occur, minimal information should be lost anyway, since we are binning among frequent age groups. This way, the model will more easily develop a prediction of how age influences promotions in general.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Model Type\n",
    "For our final model we chose to use a tree-model with max_depth=None, min_samples_leaf=2, min_samples_split=2. Through trial and error of classification models, we found that these parameters combined with the features we added gave us the best prediction values for our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fairness Evaluation\n",
    "For our fairness evaluation, we looked at the officer's ethnicity (White vs POC) to see if there was any disparity between the model's predictions of rank between the two groups. As mentioned in our explanation of our binning feature, we found it important to ensure that the model was accurate for both white people and non-white people. As such, we used an accuracy parity in our permutation test.\n",
    "#### Null Hypothesis\n",
    "The model is equally accurate for both white officers and POC officers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Alternate Hypothesis\n",
    "The model is more accurate for white officers compared to POC officers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "We used a significance value of α=0.05 for our test. After our test, we got a value of 0.015 which is well within the ranges of our histogram so we fail to reject the null hypothesis and accept that the model has parity between the accuracy of predicting promotions for white vs POC officers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Appendix\n",
    "After extensive testing, we found that our values that come from the permutation test can vary by quite a large margin (even with values up to 0.4!). We determined that there was a possibility of white officers taking up a larger proportion of the training data in these instances during the train_test_split, which could account for the wide variety of our permutation test values (and therefore rejecting the null and accepting the alt). Due to this large difference in parity values, we will keep our conclusion the same but include this warning that there is a possibility for splits in the training data that will create large gaps of parity."
